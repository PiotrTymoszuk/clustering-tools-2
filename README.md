# clustering-tools-2
An updated, comprehensive toolbox of component analysis and clustering tools based on base R, factoextra, kohonen and pcaPP package functions.

In contrast to the previous version of clustering tools (maintenance stopped), the new toolbox implements S3 OOP with a clearer plot/summary/extract API and 'lazier' evaluation, which may work better with large data sets. A further development as a package planned.
